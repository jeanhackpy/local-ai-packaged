## 2025-05-14 - Incorrect Security Overrides for AI Stack
**Vulnerability:** Services in the AI stack were not correctly shielded in "public" mode because `docker-compose.override.public.yml` only contained resets for Supabase services, which were not present in the AI stack's `docker-compose.yml`. This left services like `openclaw-gateway` exposed even when the user selected the "public" environment.
**Learning:** In a multi-stack Docker Compose setup, it's easy to copy-paste override files. If an override file is applied to a stack that doesn't contain the specified services, the `!reset null` directives do nothing, leading to a false sense of security.
**Prevention:** Always verify that environment-specific overrides correctly target the services defined in the specific base compose file they are intended for. Use `docker compose config` with the specific files to verify the final effective configuration.

## 2025-05-15 - Information Leakage in Pipe Error Handlers
**Vulnerability:** Open WebUI Pipes (n8n_pipe.py, router_pipe.py) were returning raw exception strings and API response bodies (including error text and status codes) directly to the end-user. This could expose internal network structure, configuration details, or sensitive metadata from downstream services (n8n, Ollama, OpenRouter).
**Learning:** Default exception handling often leaks `str(e)`, which in libraries like `requests` can include the full response body of a failed request. In a "Pipe" architecture where data is aggregated from multiple sources, this becomes a significant disclosure risk.
**Prevention:** Always catch exceptions in Pipes and return generic, safe error messages to the user. Log the full technical details (stack traces, raw response bodies) to `sys.stderr` or a secure logging service instead.
